## 04: Talus on Simcoe Neipa - 7%
eye: hazy, nose: guava, taste: grapefruit

It's *juicy*; Definitely getting grapefruit.

Quite hoppy, but not too to excess. 
It's not doing _too much_ of anything, other than show off the fancy hops.
Not too sweet, or too sour, strong enough to complement the hops, but not so strong that they don't take center stage.

We're still yet to see a proper "wacky" tinyrebel beer, but I can't complain too much if this is what we're getting instead.

## 05: Mosaic & Lotus Lil Neipa - 4.7%
eye: orange, nose: tropical, taste: spicy

Spicy's not unreasonable as a tasting note, it's a little zesty; refreshing, floral.
Much like yesterday, this gives a vibe of "we've found some fancy hops and we want to showcase them".
Unlike yesterday's I don't rate it quite as much, although I don't think I could point to anything it's explicitly doing wrong (although it's possible that extra 2.3% and 110ml goes a long way).
I'm going to speed review it, because I think I'll enjoy this more if I'm not overthinking it. Also it's 11 on a Sunday.

## 06: Mandarin and Yuzu Belgian Blonde - 5.0%
eye: blonde, nose: mandarin, taste: citrus

Looks mandarin orange coloured, smells mandarin orange scented, tastes mandarin orange flavoured.
This is the kind of bullshit that I signed up for, 10/10.
Tastes like eating a tiny orange, but in delicious refreshing beer form.
I have no idea what a Yuzu tastes like (relative to other citrus), but I think I can pick up on some more complicated floral notes in here, so I'm going to ascribe those to that, because doing so makes me the kind of bastard who claims to be able to pick up on the fancier notes from the Yuzu.
Colour's great, outside of the porter, this is the first one of these not to look kinda murky, I get why you'd sell a murky beer, but I still consider it kind of a negative sign.
Can design is also solid.

## 07 Citra on Cashmere Nordic IPA - 4.4%
eye: hazy, noze: funky, taste: citrus

Another hazy beer, although this shade is pretty attractive, and it's nice and crisp, but unfortunately we're back on the "Showcasing some fancy hops" beers.
With that said, it was genuinely pretty nice, here are some pleasant lemony notes, and my initial thought was refreshing.

## 08: Bypass the Centrifuge IPA - 5.7%
eye: murk, nose: dank, taste: resinous

Two things I've laid into in these reviews, deliberately murky beer, and the use of the word "dank".

With that said, this is alright; bitter - hoppy - mellow - boozy, resinous isn't the worst word (that'd be dank).
It certainly helps that I'm drinking this at the end of the day, and it's putting me to sleep.

We're still a ways away from what I was expecting in a tiny rebel box, although this note is coming up so frequently that I should probably just start calling out the "on brand" beers if and when they come up.

## 09: Italian Pils - 4.8%
eye: straw, nose: floral, taste: crisp

Crisp, refreshing, smooth, floral, fizzy, somewhat dry.
All good things in a continental lager, none of which really scream winter beer.
I keep alternating between wanting to describe this as floral or fruity, it's certainly not juicy, but more of a crisp berry, like a gooseberry or redcurrant.
I'm not really sure what makes this Italian, it's a German style pilsner, and the hops, "Hallertau Blanc", are bred, in Germany, for American style ale.

Still, while we're six months away from the part of the year when I'd _really_ enjoy this, it's a reasonable tipple.


## 13: Shandy Bassy - 2.5%
eye: chessnut, nose: beer, taste: shandy

First things first, great name, great can design.

While you might reasonably be disapointed by getting a can of shandy in a beer box, I can forgive it as only 4% of the total beers.
Also, my shameful secret is that I genuinely enjoy a good shandy, and this is a legitimately good shandy.
Dark, crisp and damn mellow, by which I think I mean bitter, maybe a little too far on the dry side, but flavour wise there's a lot going on.


## 14: Florida Orange IPA - 4.5%
eye: orange, nose: orange, taste: orange

Strong taste of orange zest, also the dry hoppy bitterness that you expect from an IPA.
Possibly a bit too much of both, it's _very clearly_ an IPA.

It is a little bit juicy, and a little bit tart, but it's zestier than it is either of those things; I wouldn't describe this as an accessible taste.
Another beer which would gain points if this were July, rather than December.   

## 15: Kviek IPA - 5.8%
eye: pale, nose: grape, taste: candied

On the one hand , this is another pleasant, crisp, refreshing, balanced well executed IPA.
On the other, yet another fucking IPA.

At least compared to yesterday's, this is very easily drinkable.
The hoppy tanginess of an IPA is present, but not to excess.
And there's a pleasant juiciness to balance it out.


## 16: Chuckleberry Radler - 2.5%
eye: chuckleberry, nose:chuckleberry, taste: chuckleberry

This is excellent, like the cherry sour, it's safely weird, but while the cherry sour made me think "Oh dear, Oh dear", this Radler demonstrates a real vision, I don't have anything bad to say about the execution.
Properly sharp, (a chuckleberry's apparently part redcurrant, part gooseberry and part jostaberry), and aggressively red and fruity, it's simultaneously electrifying and delicious, really delivers on those berry notes.
Whereas the cherry sour wasn't really a sour, this hits all the right sour notes.
Like most very tart drinks, I could see this not being the most accessible thing ever, it's spot on "to me", "to you", who can tell.

## 17: Belgian Dubel IPA - 6.8%
eye: hazy, nose : spicy, taste: stonefruit

Certainly full bodied.
Strong, and sweet, in a lot of ways, similar to day 1.
Lots of interesting spicy notes that I don't think I can enumerate without sounding a bit wanky, but in two words, spicy and juicy.
Can say's it's using "Abbaye yeast", which is a Belgian ale yeast, and there's no denying that this hits a lot of typical "Belgian beer" notes.
I'm a sucker for strongish Belgian beers, so I really like this, it's not "just another IPA".
