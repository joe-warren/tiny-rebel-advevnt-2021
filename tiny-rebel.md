## 01- Citra on Mosaic Cryo Triple IPA - 10% 
eye: golden, nose: citrus, taste: stonefruit

They're clearly starting with a _big_ beer (440ml 10%), it's 10%, and tastes like a 10% beer. 
It's rich and creamy, very slight note of sharp citrussy flavour, but the overarching sensation is "this is going to put me to sleep".
I think it's pretty well balanced, not one of those "overly hoppy" IPAs that people bitch about, you can taste the hops, but they're an afternote, behind the malty beery. 
Colour's gold, it's relatively murky, little bit of head too (decent carbonation). 
I can see why you'd open with this, although it's almost like a pressure drop beer, fancy, but not too mad; I'm hoping the later beers get a little more bonkers.  

## 02 - Watermelon and Mint Lil IPA - 4.5%
eye: pink, nose: mint, taste watermelon

This is _interesting_, it's quite sharp, which I like. 
I'm getting more of the mint than I am watermelon. 
This is probably a good thing, but the end result is quite herby. 
There are _notes_ of watermelon, but I found you really had to go looking for them whereas the mint was _right there_; I keep having flashbacks to lamb chops that I've eaten over the years. 
If anything, I think the tasting notes are backwards, the watermelon comes across more on the scent, whereas the taste is mostly mint. 
It's possible that of the two flavours, I'm just more familiar with mint (eat a fair amount of it, magical in a bulgur wheat salad - haven't had watermelon in years).

Colour's good, still a little cloudy, but not so much as beer No.1, the pinkness is understated, but attractive. 

Considering the blurb calls it "Juicy" it's pretty dry. 
It's definitely "actual watermelon taste" as opposed to "fake watermelon flavoured". 

Don't get me wrong, it's very nice, just not _quite_ what I was expecting – I'm glad the concept is more zany than the first beer – the execution is perhaps a little serious.  

## 03 - Imperial Porter - 10%
eye: midnight, nose: treacle, taste: cocoa

I'm a big fan of dark beers, and this is, in my opinion, smashing. 
I get the cocoa comparison, it's strong, rich and puddingy, while still delivering on that classic "imperial stout" flavour. 
It's pretty nice that this is wintery, definitely a seasonal beer. 

I wish I had more of this, it's the first 330ml one in the box. On the other hand, it's hilarious that I'm going to come out of having _just_ drunk one small can of beer feeling relatively drunk. 

Like Beer 01, it's quite sweet and creamy, but IMO, the relative darkness, heaviness and intensity of flavour means it carries that, if it wasn't it'd risk being too bitter. 



## 04: Talus on Simcoe Neipa - 7%
eye: hazy, nose: guava, taste: grapefruit

It's *juicy*; Definitely getting grapefruit.

Quite hoppy, but not too to excess. 
It's not doing _too much_ of anything, other than show off the fancy hops.
Not too sweet, or too sour, strong enough to complement the hops, but not so strong that they don't take center stage.

We're still yet to see a proper "wacky" tinyrebel beer, but I can't complain too much if this is what we're getting instead.

## 05: Mosaic & Lotus Lil Neipa - 4.7%
eye: orange, nose: tropical, taste: spicy

Spicy's not unreasonable as a tasting note, it's a little zesty; refreshing, floral.
Much like yesterday, this gives a vibe of "we've found some fancy hops and we want to showcase them".
Unlike yesterday's I don't rate it quite as much, although I don't think I could point to anything it's explicitly doing wrong (although it's possible that extra 2.3% and 110ml goes a long way).
I'm going to speed review it, because I think I'll enjoy this more if I'm not overthinking it. Also it's 11 on a Sunday.

## 06: Mandarin and Yuzu Belgian Blonde - 5.0%
eye: blonde, nose: mandarin, taste: citrus

Looks mandarin orange coloured, smells mandarin orange scented, tastes mandarin orange flavoured.
This is the kind of bullshit that I signed up for, 10/10.
Tastes like eating a tiny orange, but in delicious refreshing beer form.
I have no idea what a Yuzu tastes like (relative to other citrus), but I think I can pick up on some more complicated floral notes in here, so I'm going to ascribe those to that, because doing so makes me the kind of bastard who claims to be able to pick up on the fancier notes from the Yuzu.
Colour's great, outside of the porter, this is the first one of these not to look kinda murky, I get why you'd sell a murky beer, but I still consider it kind of a negative sign.
Can design is also solid.

## 07 Citra on Cashmere Nordic IPA - 4.4%
eye: hazy, noze: funky, taste: citrus

Another hazy beer, although this shade is pretty attractive, and it's nice and crisp, but unfortunately we're back on the "Showcasing some fancy hops" beers.
With that said, it was genuinely pretty nice, here are some pleasant lemony notes, and my initial thought was refreshing.

## 08: Bypass the Centrifuge IPA - 5.7%
eye: murk, nose: dank, taste: resinous

Two things I've laid into in these reviews, deliberately murky beer, and the use of the word "dank".

With that said, this is alright; bitter - hoppy - mellow - boozy, resinous isn't the worst word (that'd be dank).
It certainly helps that I'm drinking this at the end of the day, and it's putting me to sleep.

We're still a ways away from what I was expecting in a tiny rebel box, although this note is coming up so frequently that I should probably just start calling out the "on brand" beers if and when they come up.

## 09: Italian Pils - 4.8%
eye: straw, nose: floral, taste: crisp

Crisp, refreshing, smooth, floral, fizzy, somewhat dry.
All good things in a continental lager, none of which really scream winter beer.
I keep alternating between wanting to describe this as floral or fruity, it's certainly not juicy, but more of a crisp berry, like a gooseberry or redcurrant.
I'm not really sure what makes this Italian, it's a German style pilsner, and the hops, "Hallertau Blanc", are bred, in Germany, for American style ale.

Still, while we're six months away from the part of the year when I'd _really_ enjoy this, it's a reasonable tipple.

## 10 - Chocolate and Hazelnut Waffle - 6.5%
eye: dark, nose: nutella, taste: nutella

This was the one beer I (we?) was psyched for before getting the box, and you might expect it to be anticlimactic, by definition.

I actually think it hits all the notes I might have conceivably wanted. 
Perfectly serviceable chocolate stout, which again, is the kind of thing that I _really like_; black as the devil and sweeter than a stolen kiss ; richer and creamier than Jeff Bezos in a dairy.
The hazelnut notes come through, and also complement the chocolate really well (this isn't surprising, because Nutella works).
I'm not _really_ getting anything that I'd describe as waffle, without really squinting, although I don't know how I'd distinguish waffle from "regular malty beer taste", and two out of three of the intended flavours isn't bad.
Anyway, I fully expect this to be the highlight of the box, so it's all downhill from here.

## 11 - Cold Fermented IPA - 5.5% 
eye: straw, nose: gooseberry, taste: crisp

If my baseline for "interesting tiny-rebel beers" wasn't "jam doughnut flavour", this would qualify as pretty interesting. 
It's worth caveating today's notes with the fact that I'm the kind of knackered where pretty much anything would make me think "mnn, delicious beer", so this isn't me at my most critical.
It's well balanced, not too eccentric, but very crisp, bordering on tart, I overuse the word "refreshing", but it fits. 
While I'm not a huge believer in tasting notes, I'm genuinely getting gooseberry. 
Despite the initial hit of crispness, there are some more bitter, nuanced notes, that take a little longer to hit, and linger further back on the tongue. 
Attractive eye, relatively clear by the standards of the box, and a decent level of carbonation.

## 12 - Blue Raspberry and Cotton Candy Sour - 4.8%
eye: blue, nose: sweetshop, taste candy. 

On one level, yes, we're back on the bullshit!
With that said, this doesn't really work for me, while it goes _relatively_ hard on the blue raspberry, this isn't a sour by any stretch of the imagination. 
If you've ever had a Bacchus Framboise, it's not lightyears away from that, possibly somewhat sweeter, definitely not quite as good, even compared to the more modern recipe Bacchus Framboise, as opposed to the far superior Bacchus Framboise of my youth. 
The taste's not terrible, but the name suggested that it was going to have more oomph, and it doesn't.
Colour is great; back when I was reviewing Fantas, I had a Pepsi Blue delivered alongside the Fantas, and described that as looking like a "cross between a molten Sonic the Hedgehog, and an as yet unused chemical toilet". 
This isn't quite that bad, but it's close, although I'm 100% of the opinion that, in a box of novelty advent calender beers, the appearance of something with these visuals is 100% a good thing.
It's nice to get something a bit "fruitier", but I couldn't hand on heart claim this was to my taste.

## 13: Shandy Bassy - 2.5%
eye: chessnut, nose: beer, taste: shandy

First things first, great name, great can design.

While you might reasonably be disapointed by getting a can of shandy in a beer box, I can forgive it as only 4% of the total beers.
Also, my shameful secret is that I genuinely enjoy a good shandy, and this is a legitimately good shandy.
Dark, crisp and damn mellow, by which I think I mean bitter, maybe a little too far on the dry side, but flavour wise there's a lot going on.

## 14: Florida Orange IPA - 4.5%
eye: orange, nose: orange, taste: orange

Strong taste of orange zest, also the dry hoppy bitterness that you expect from an IPA.
Possibly a bit too much of both, it's _very clearly_ an IPA.

It is a little bit juicy, and a little bit tart, but it's zestier than it is either of those things; I wouldn't describe this as an accessible taste.
Another beer which would gain points if this were July, rather than December.   

## 15: Kviek IPA - 5.8%
eye: pale, nose: grape, taste: candied

On the one hand , this is another pleasant, crisp, refreshing, balanced well executed IPA.
On the other, yet another fucking IPA.

At least compared to yesterday's, this is very easily drinkable.
The hoppy tanginess of an IPA is present, but not to excess.
And there's a pleasant juiciness to balance it out.


## 16: Chuckleberry Radler - 2.5%
eye: chuckleberry, nose:chuckleberry, taste: chuckleberry

This is excellent, like the cherry sour, it's safely weird, but while the cherry sour made me think "Oh dear, Oh dear", this Radler demonstrates a real vision, I don't have anything bad to say about the execution.
Properly sharp, (a chuckleberry's apparently part redcurrant, part gooseberry and part jostaberry), and aggressively red and fruity, it's simultaneously electrifying and delicious, really delivers on those berry notes.
Whereas the cherry sour wasn't really a sour, this hits all the right sour notes.
Like most very tart drinks, I could see this not being the most accessible thing ever, it's spot on "to me", "to you", who can tell.

## 17: Belgian Dubel IPA - 6.8%
eye: hazy, nose : spicy, taste: stonefruit

Certainly full bodied.
Strong, and sweet, in a lot of ways, similar to day 1.
Lots of interesting spicy notes that I don't think I can enumerate without sounding a bit wanky, but in two words, spicy and juicy.
Can say's it's using "Abbaye yeast", which is a Belgian ale yeast, and there's no denying that this hits a lot of typical "Belgian beer" notes.
I'm a sucker for strongish Belgian beers, so I really like this, it's not "just another IPA".

## 18: Christmas Cake Belgian Quadrupel - 12%
eye/nose/taste: christmas cake

Tastes dense and boozy, like a good Christmas cake, maybe not quite as dense as I'd like.
With the exception of the fact that it's relatively highly carbonated, this is weirdly unsurprising. 
Notes of fruits, and nuts, much like a Christmas cake; Dark, dense, and sweet (but not _as sweet_ as it could have been), much like a Christmas cake; Gorgeous vibrant pink can, okay maybe there the comparison falls down.
I do like this, although at the top of the glass, I wrote the following: I felt like I was expecting to like it more; although it's _modestly_ dark and rich, I think I'd like this to taste darker and richer.
As I'm moving father down it, I'm liking this more and more, and while it could be the effect of the alcohol, I think it was probably just over chilled when I started, so maybe that's on me. 
Definitely getting the "Christmas cake fruits", raisins and sultanas et cetera , no complaints about the extent to which this approximates a cake. 
Ignoring the cakiness, which is excellent, it's not doing a huge amount else, I don't know why they're calling it a "Belgian Quadrupel" per say: don't infuse it with Christmas cake ingredients and you could sell this as an imperial stout.
With that said, the Christmas cake flavour carries it; Seasons Greetings!
